# tint

tint is a Turing machine interpreter written in Go.
It is a great environment to design and easily test Turing machines.

## Goal

My goal for tint is that it gives people learning about Turing machines some hands-on experience.
When I learned about finite state automata as an undergraduate, my favorite part was building the machines and understanding how each one works.

## Plans

- [ ] Config files to build Turing machines
- [ ] CLI to build and test Turing machines
- [ ] QoL changes
